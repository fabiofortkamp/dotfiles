# dotfiles

This is a primitive atempt to sync my dotfiles. Everything is manual
at this point.

## Installation

1. Install zsh and set it as your default shell;
2. Install [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) and [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa); before that,  it might be a good idea also to install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) and use it to install Rust and the previous projects;
3. Install [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/);
4. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh);
5. Clone this repository with 
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/dotfiles ~/dotfiles`. 
Currently, this repo must be cloned at the home directory;
6. Remove the file generated by oh-my-zsh (it will be replaced) with `rm ~/.zshrc`;
7. Create symlinks: 

- `ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/zshrc" "$HOME/.zshrc"`;
- `mkdir -p "$HOME/.config" && ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/config/lvim" "$HOME/.config/lvim"`;
- `mkdir -p "$HOME/.julia" && ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/julia/config" "$HOME/.julia/config"

## Features

### VS Code Insiders 

VS Code Insiders is set as the default editor, unless in a SSH session, where regular vim is used.

This repo has some VS Code Insiders workspace-specific settings that I like to use for
this particular project:

- Theme: Atom Dark One

### prm

This repo includes 
[my fork of the prm project](https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/prm).

### `custom` folder and the `local` script

The scripts in the `custom` folder are executed in alphabetical order; 
the `custom/local.zsh` is also loaded but it is ignored by git. This is a good
place to put local configurations that you don't want to share with the
world.
