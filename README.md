# dotfiles

This is a primitive atempt to sync my dotfiles. Everything is manual
at this point.

## Installation

1. Install zsh and set it as your default shell;
2. Install [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) and [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa); before that,  it might be a good idea also to install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) and use it to install Rust and the previous projects;
3. Install [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/installation) and its dependencies;
4. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh);
5. Clone this repository with 
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/dotfiles ~/dotfiles`. 
Currently, this repo must be cloned at the home directory;
6. Remove the file generated by oh-my-zsh (it will be replaced) with `rm ~/.zshrc`;
7. Create a symlink: `ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/zshrc" "$HOME/.zshrc"`;
8. Create a symlink to LunarVim configuration: `ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/config/lvim" "$HOME/.config/lvim`


## Features

### LunarVim

LunarVim is set as the default editor, unless in a SSH session, where regular vim is used.

### prm

This repo includes 
[my fork of the prm project](https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/prm).

### VS Code Insiders

This repo has some VS Code Insiders workspace-specific settings that I like to use for
this particular project:

- Theme: Atom Dark One

### custom folder

The scripts in the `custom` folder are executed in alphabetical order.
