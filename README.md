# dotfiles

This is a primitive atempt to sync my dotfiles. Everything is manual at this point.

## Installation

1. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). 
2. Clone this repository. Assuming the home directory, create a symlink at:

```zsh
ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/zshrc" "$HOME/.zshrc"
```
